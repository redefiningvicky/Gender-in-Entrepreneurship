# 🤝 Gender in Entrepreneurship
## 🎯 Objective <br>
This project analyzes the impact of both dependent and independent variables on women’s entrepreneurship globally. It examines conditions for women entrepreneurs across global economies by evaluating five independent variables: borrowing, costs, savings, procedures, and time required to start a business, and their effect on the dependent variable, the Women, Business, and the Law: Entrepreneurship Indicator Score. The analysis aligns with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) #5 (Gender Equality) and #8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth). <p>
